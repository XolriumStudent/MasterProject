# MasterProject: 
### What are the behaviourial changes of NPC's in a simulation environment set by the player?
In this project my goal is to do research on how a simulation can be affected by variables set by a player, and if this can be used as enjoyable gameplay.

#### Prototype 1: Movement towards object or other NPC

#### Prototype 2: Interactable Object System
